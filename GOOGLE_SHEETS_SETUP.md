## Backend Credentials

1. Create a Google Cloud service account.
2. Create a JSON key for that service account.
3. Share the Google Sheet with the service account email as an editor.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
5. Fill in:

```text
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
```

The private key should stay on one line in `.env`, with `\n` where the key has line breaks.

Start the backend:

```text
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```
